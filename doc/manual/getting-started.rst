Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

First you need to download and install NovaProva.  Here are several
ways you can do this, starting with the easiest.

From The OpenSUSE Build Service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NovaProva is available in installable repositories for many recent Linux
distributions at
`the OpenSUSE Build Service <http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/gnb:/novaprova/>`_.

For Debian/Ubuntu systems, copy and paste the following commands.

.. highlight:: sh

::

    # Choose a distro
    distro=xUbuntu_12.04
    
    # This is the base URL for the NovaProva repo
    repo=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/gnb:/novaprova/$distro
    
    # Download and install the repository GPG key
    wget -O - $repo/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -
    
    # Add an APT source
    sudo bash -c "echo 'deb $repo ./' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/novaprova.list"
    sudo apt-get update
    
    # Install NovaProva
    sudo apt-get install novaprova

See `here <http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Enduser_Info>`_ for RedHat and SUSE instructions.

From A Release Tarball
++++++++++++++++++++++

First, download a release tarball.

NovaProva is intended to be built in the usual way that any open source
C software is built.  It has a `configure` script generated by autoconf,
which you run before building.
To build you need to have various pieces of software installed, starting
with a typical C development environment and adding the Valgrind header
file `valgrind.h` and the XML and BFD libraries.  On an Ubuntu system, these
commands download and install them.

.. highlight:: sh

::

    # on Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        gcc g++ git autoconf automake libxml2-dev libxml2-utils \
        pkg-config valgrind binutils-dev zlib1g-dev libiberty-dev

Once you have those prerequisites installed, you can download, install
and build NovaProva.

.. highlight:: sh

::

    # download the release tarball from https://github.com/novaprova/novaprova/releases
    
    tar -xvf novaprova-1.1.tar.bz2
    cd novaprova-1.1
    ./configure
    make
    make install

From Read-Only Git
++++++++++++++++++

For advanced users only.  NovaProva needs several more tools to build
from a Git checkout than from a release tarball, mainly for the
documentation.  You will need to have `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org/>`_,
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, and
`Breathe <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/breathe>`_ installed.  On an Ubuntu
system, these commands download and install them.

.. highlight:: sh

::

    # on Ubuntu
    # install all the prereqs above, then add...
    sudo apt-get install -y doxygen python-pip
    sudo pip install breathe Sphinx

Once you have those prerequisites installed, you can clone, install
and build NovaProva.

.. highlight:: sh

::

    git clone https://github.com/novaprova/novaprova.git
    cd novaprova
    autoreconf -iv
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Building a Test Executable
--------------------------

Because you're testing C code, the first step is to build a test runner
executable.  This executable will contain all your tests and the Code Under Test
and will be linked against the NovaProva
library and whatever other libraries your Code Under Test needs.  Typically, this
is done using the `check:` make target to both build and run the tests.

Start by creating a Makefile containing:

.. highlight:: make

::

    # Makefile
    all: libmycode.a
    
    MYCODE_SOURCE=      mycode.c
    MYCODE_OBJS=        $(MYCODE_SOURCE:.c=.o)
    
    libmycode.a: $(MYCODE_OBJS)
            ar ruv $@ $(MYCODE_OBJS)
            ranlib $@

    NOVAPROVA_CFLAGS= $(shell pkg-config --cflags novaprova)
    NOVAPROVA_LIBS= $(shell pkg-config --libs novaprova)
    
    CFLAGS= -g $(NOVAPROVA_CFLAGS)
    
    check: testrunner
            ./testrunner
    
    TEST_SOURCE= mytest.c
    TEST_OBJS=  $(TEST_SOURCE:.c=.o)
    
    testrunner:  $(TEST_OBJS) libmycode.a
            $(LINK.c) -o $@ $(TEST_OBJS) libmycode.a $(NOVAPROVA_LIBS)
    
    clean:
            $(RM) testrunner libmycode.a $(TEST_OBJS) $(MYCODE_OBJS)

NovaProva uses the GNOME `pkgconfig` system to make it easy to
find the right set of compile and link flags.

Note that you only need to compile the test code `mytest.c`
with `NOVAPROVA_CFLAGS`.  NovaProva does *not*
use any magical compile options or do any pre-processing of your test code
or Code Under Test.

However, you should make sure that at least the test code is built with
the `-g` option to include debugging information.  NovaProva uses that
information to discover tests at runtime.

You do not need to provide a `main` routine.  NovaProva provides a
default `main` routine which implements a number of useful command-line
options.  You can write your own later, but you probably won't need to.

Now let's create an example Code Under Test.  It contains
the function `myatoi` which has the same signature and semantics
as the well-known `atoi` function in the standard C library.
We have a header file:

.. highlight:: c

::

    /* mycode.h */
    #ifndef __mycode_h_
    #define __mycode_h_ 1
    
    extern int myatoi(const char *);
    
    #endif /* __mycode_h_ */

and a source file:

.. highlight:: c

::

    /* mycode.c */
    #include "mycode.h"
    
    int myatoi(const char *s)
    {
        int v = 0;
    
        for ( ; *s ; s++)
        {
            v *= 10;
            v += (*s - '0');
        }
    
        return v;
    }


The last piece of the puzzle is writing some tests.  Each test is a
single C function which takes no parameters and returns `void`.  Unlike
other unit test frameworks, there's no API to call or magical macro to
use to register tests with the library.  Instead you just name the
function `test_something`, and NovaProva will automatically create a
test called `something` which calls the function.

For example, let's create a test called `simple` which exercises
the most basic functionality of `myatoi()`.

--------------------------------------------------
.. highlight:: c

::

    /* mytest.c */
    #include <np.h>	    /* NovaProva library */
    #include "mycode.h" /* declares the Code Under Test */
    
    static void test_simple(void)
    {
        int r;
    
        r = myatoi("42");
        NP_ASSERT_EQUAL(r, 42);
    }

The macro `NP_ASSERT_EQUAL` checks that it's two integer arguments are
equal, and if not fails the test.  Note that if the assert fails, the
test function terminates immediately.  If the test function gets to it's
end and returns naturally, the test is considered to have passed.

If we build run this test we get output something like this.

.. highlight:: sh

::

    % make check
    ./testrunner
    np: starting valgrind
    np: running
    np: running: "mytest.simple"
    PASS mytest.simple
    np: 1 run 0 failed

As expected, the test passed.

NovaProva organises tests into a tree whose
node names are derived from the test source directory, test source filename,
and test function name.  This tree is pruned down to the smallest possible
size at which the root of the tree is unique.  So the name `mytest.simple`
derives from the name of the function `test_simple` in source file `mytest.c`.

Now let's add another test.  The `myatoi()`
function is supposed to convert the initial numeric part of the argument
string, i.e. to stop when it sees a non-numeric character.  Let's feed
it a string which will exercise this behaviour and see what happens.

.. highlight:: c

::

    /* add this to the end of mytest.c */
    
    static void test_initial(void)
    {
        int r;
    
        r = myatoi("4=2");
        NP_ASSERT_EQUAL(r, 4);
    }

Running the tests we see:

.. highlight:: sh

::

    % make check
    ./testrunner
    np: starting valgrind
    np: running
    np: running: "mytest.simple"
    PASS mytest.simple
    np: running: "mytest.initial"
    EVENT ASSERT NP_ASSERT_EQUAL(r=532, 4=4)
    at 0x80529F2: np::spiegel::describe_stacktrace (np/spiegel/spiegel.cxx)
    by 0x804C0FC: np::event_t::with_stack (np/event.cxx)
    by 0x804B2D2: __np_assert_failed (uasserts.c)
    by 0x804AC27: test_initial (mytest.c)
    by 0x80522D0: np::spiegel::function_t::invoke (np/spiegel/spiegel.cxx)
    by 0x804C731: np::runner_t::run_function (np/runner.cxx)
    by 0x804D5C4: np::runner_t::run_test_code (np/runner.cxx)
    by 0x804D831: np::runner_t::begin_job (np/runner.cxx)
    by 0x804E0D4: np::runner_t::run_tests (np/runner.cxx)
    by 0x804E22C: np_run_tests (np/runner.cxx)
    by 0x804AB12: main (main.c)
    
    FAIL mytest.initial
    np: 2 run 1 failed
    make: *** [check] Error 1

Note also that the new test failed.  Immediately after the "np: running:"
message we see that the `NP_ASSERT_EQUAL` macro has failed, and printed both
its arguments as well as a stack trace.  We expected the variable `r` to equal
to 4 but its actual value at runtime was 532; clearly the `myatoi` function
did not behave correctly.  We found a bug!

And now you're testing with NovaProva.  The remainder of this document
contains everything you need to know to get the best out of NovaProva.
Best of luck and good testing!
